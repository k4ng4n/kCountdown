# kCountdown
Author: Kangan  
  
This addon for Runes of Magic implements a minimap button to start or cancel a 15s countdown in group chat! Additionally it shows the current countdown number in the middle of your screen with a warn sound for ***everyone who has the addon***, so you don't miss the countdown.
